                <p>The Reiek Village Resort is a heritage village that lies at the base of the mountain while another resort attached to the village, is located half way up. The heritage village is a typical Mizo village with an entrance gate and distinctive traditional huts of the different Mizo sub-tribes. You can also catch a glimpse of the Mizo chieftain’s house, a bachelor’s dormitory and the residence of a widow. The houses are fully preserved in their original state, giving the visitor aninsight into the glorious past of these valiant highlanders. A few Mizo modern houses have also been constructed nearby to show the changes that have taken place in the Mizo way of life while keeping pace with the modern developments.
                    The resort has a cafeteria providing decent food and accommodation.
