                                <p>It is one of the most interesting places in Assam and perhaps the only place in the
                                    state where one may find shrines and temples dedicated to Vishnu, Siva, Durga, the
                                    Buddha and a Muslim saint.
                                    It is the confluence of three major religious orders of the world - Hinduism, Islam
                                    and Buddhism. People belonging to each of the three religious orders consider Hajo
                                    as a sacred place.
                                    The Hayagriva Madhava Mandir (or Hyagreeva Madhav Temple, or Hayagriba Madhav) is
                                    the most famous temple of Hajo. The present temple structure was constructed by the
                                    King Raghudeva Narayan in 1583.
                                    According to some historians the King of Pala dynasty constructed it in 6th century.
                                    It is a stone temple and it enshrines an image of Hayagriva Madhava.
                                    Hajo is also a Muslim pilgrimage centre. The Muslim shrine, Poa-Mecca or Powa-Mecca
                                    is the most famous Muslim pilgrimage spot in Assam and is noted as the tomb of Pir
                                    Giasuddin Auliya, who was the pioneer
                                    of Islam in this part of the world. It is also known as Poa-Mecca because it is
                                    supposed to be one fourth in sanctity to Mecca. It is believed that Poa-Mecca was
                                    constructed from the soil that was brought
                                </p>

                                    through the city of Guwahati in Assam, a state in northeast India.
                                    Its name derives from Assamese Uma, another name for the Hindu goddess Parvati, the
                                    wife of Shiva;
                                    and ananda, which translates to "joy". A British officer named

                                    peacock. It is also known as Bhasmachal, from the words bhasma,
                                    meaning 'to destroy', and chal, meaning 'place'. The legend giving rise to this name

                                    the god of love in Hindu mythology,
                                    after interrupting Shiva in the middle of a deep meditation on the islet, was burnt
                                    to ashes.
