                                    state, are engaged in agriculture.
                                    The largest crop is wet rice, cultivated in the valleys and on hillside terraces.

                                <p>Deep in the heart of the Garo Hills in Meghalaya, India, lies a hidden paradise known
                                    as Wari Chora. This otherworldly landscape
                                    is characterized by towering cliffs, crystal-clear streams, and a deep canyon that
                                    is home to a mysterious natural phenomenon.
                                    The Garo people, who have inhabited this region for centuries, believe that the
                                    canyon is home to seven giant serpents.
                                    These creatures are said to be the guardians of the land, and their presence is said
                                    to bring good luck to those who visit.
                                    Nestled between the picturesque Pharomgre and Rekmangre villages in the South Garo
                                    Hills, Wari Chora offers a unique
                                    experience amidst canyons and the tranquil turquoise waters of the Rongdik River.
                                    When it comes to accommodation in Wari Chora,
                                    it’s important to note that the area is relatively far from Shillong and other major
                                    cities or towns. Therefore, staying overnight is a
                                    convenient and recommended option for those looking to fully immerse themselves in
                                    the beauty of the place.

                                <p>Phe Phe Falls is a two-tier waterfall. Phe Phe is a Jaintia word that translates to
                                    Paradise (Jaintia is one of the major ethnic groups of Meghalaya).
                                    The location of the waterfall makes it more thrilling. Descending a steep hill,
                                    through the shrub bamboo plants, the sight of the waterfall in the backdrop
                                    of the blue sky and the range of hills layered with light and shadow on the other
                                    side, we entered the realm of paradise. The waterfall has its own charm and essence.
                                    The water is as blue as the sky, clean transparent and above all, cold.

                                <p>The people of this village are largely farmers who cultivate betel nut, betel leaves,
                                    broom grass and other cultivation which they depend their
                                    livelihood on. One of the famous landmarks is an old living root bridge in the

                                    around 400 years old. The other landmark, which has gained a lot of tourist
                                    attraction in the past couple of months, is a place below the
                                    village called Shmia Syntem. It is a river valley along the Umngot river trails and
                                    takes approximately an hour to descend to the riverbank.
                                    The village is blessed with an abundance of water and has kept running drinking
                                    water through bamboo connected from the hilltop reaching down to
                                    the riverbank in the bottom. There are rocks and stones laid down in a structured
                                    manner by the ancestors to pave the way down to the riverbank.
                                    There is also a living root bridge, which the ancestors made and it is called Rbang
                                    U Thlah. The pathway to the bridge is very steep so, bamboo
                                    railings are kept on the side for support as this is the main path for the villagers

                                <p>Nohwet is more than just a village; it's a place where you can immerse yourself in
                                    the local culture and traditions. The Khongsdam family,
                                    who established the village nearly 200 years ago, continues to be an integral part
                                    of its history and culture. Here, you will be introduced to the
                                    beauty and tranquillity of Nohwet through stories of the village’s rich heritage.
                                    One of Nohwet's most remarkable attractions is the “Living Root Bridge,”
                                    a marvel of natural engineering created by the Khasi people over generations. This
                                    ancient bridge, formed by guiding the roots of rubber trees across a
                                    stream, is a testament to the villagers' deep connection with nature. Walking across
                                    the Living Root Bridge feels like stepping into a different world,
                                    where nature and humanity exist in perfect harmony.</p>

                                    Shillong. During the 1890s, Mawphlang was the hub of the Presbyterian Church of

                                    One of the main attractions of this village is the sacred grove that lies in the
                                    area, since indigenous and traditional communities in the state not only consider
                                    the medicinal woods and plants in the area to be holy in nature
                                    but also consider the area itself to be sacred and holy. According to the villagers,
                                    this area carries extreme significance to them as it serves as a link
                                    between nature and man.</p>
