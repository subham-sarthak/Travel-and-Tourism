                                    Almighty. The Ratha Yatra, the annual festival of the
                                    temple, is an important festival that is celebrated with great zeal and fervour and

                                    The beauty of Jagannath Temple lies in the fact that the temple is as much a place
                                    of architectural beauty and prestige as it is
                                    of religious importance. This grand building to date continues to make Tripura proud
                                    because of its architectural magnanimity and
                                    is heavily influenced by the Islamic style of edifices. The base of the Jagannath
                                    temple is an octagon in shape with brightly
                                    coloured orange walls. Pyramidal conic structures adorn the pillars of the temple.
